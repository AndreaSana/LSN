# Numerical Simulation Laboratory

This is a collection of exercises created during the 'Laboratorio di Simulazione Numerica' (Numerical Simulation Laboratory) course taken at UNIMI (A.A. 2023-2024).

The exercises are divided into their corresponding folders. In the `Notebooks` folder, there are the Jupyter Notebooks that contain the assignments and solutions to the exercises.

Some exercises will use the `armadillo` libraries and Exercise 10 uses `mpich` implementation of the MPI interaface.

## Compilation and Execution
Each subfolder contains a `Makefile` that can be used to compile the code using the `make` command and to execute it with `make run` command. To remove `*.o` and `*.exe` files, you can use the `make clean` command.
