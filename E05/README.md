In this exercise, there are four files: 
- `main.cpp` measures the mean radius.
- `main2.cpp` runs the simulation with a different number of steps in each block.
- `main3.cpp` runs the simulation with different starting points.
- `main4.cpp` samples the positions distributed according to the wave functions.

To execute a file, you can use the `make run_main` command, adding the corresponding number for the file.
